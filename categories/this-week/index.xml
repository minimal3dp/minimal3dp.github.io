&lt;p>I am currently working on several projects this week. They include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://minimal3dp.com/projects/ideas/voron-2.4-r2/">Voron 2.4 R2 Pro+ Build&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://kevinakasam.com/belt-driven-ender-3/">Belt Driven Ender 3&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>STEM Outreach&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="voron-24-r2-pro-build">Voron 2.4 R2 Pro+ Build&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#voron-24-r2-pro-build" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have started getting together my project website for my Voron build. One of the newer ideas I am trying is to create a project website. I am hoping that it makes it easier for me to save references and other links. I typically try to research a project before I begin and it will make it to asier to share my research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the Voron build, I have mostly saved basic references from the &lt;a href="https://vorondesign.com/">Voron site&lt;/a>. I have also saved doc from the FormBot site. They appear to have some updated instructions for their kits.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="belt-driven-ender-3">Belt Driven Ender 3&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#belt-driven-ender-3" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I stumbled across this project a while ago. It seemed like an interesting conversion for my Ender 3 v2. This week I am going to work on adding a project website and printing the needed parts. The hardware cost less than $30 USD.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="stem-outreach">STEM Outreach&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#stem-outreach" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As part of my job, I sometimes do STEM outreach with local schools. This usually involves taking a 3D printer and talking to kids (and parents) about STEM careers. Before I go to an event, I have gotten into the habit of 3D printing a bunch of print-in-place and flexi animals to give out. This week I am hoping to print 100 animals.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
