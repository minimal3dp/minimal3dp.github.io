# **Minimal 3DP: A Comprehensive Brand Specification and Technical Knowledge Base**

## **1.0 Brand Preamble: Core Identity and Mission**

This section defines the foundational identity of the Minimal 3DP brand, its creator, and its core philosophical principles. This serves as the primary context for defining the brand's voice, mission, and strategic direction.

### **1.1 Creator Identification**

The Minimal 3DP brand is operated and authored by its sole creator, Michael "Mike" Wilson.1 The brand is a direct reflection of the creator's personal technical projects, documentation, and "journey of discovery".1 The creator's name is part of the brand's public-facing identity, appearing in copyrights and author bylines.2

### **1.2 Brand Name and Core Mission**

The brand's public-facing name is "Minimal 3DP".4 The stated mission is to serve as a "complete 3D printing resource".4 This mission is driven by the creator's personal goal of documenting his work, creating a "repository of knowledge," and sharing his "journey of discovery" as he explores 3D printing and technology interests.1

A key analysis of the brand's name, "Minimal 3DP," reveals that "Minimal" is a *functional* descriptor, not an *aesthetic* one. The brand's content pillars are not simple; they include highly complex topics such as Klipper firmware, multi-part Voron printer builds, and advanced OrcaSlicer calibration techniques.5 The creator's own written guides are self-described as "Detailed (And Boring)" 1, which runs counter to a philosophy of aesthetic minimalism.

The meaning of "Minimal" is found in the creator's *actions* and *tooling*:

1. The original "Klipper Calibration Spreadsheet" was created to "help myself keep track of and remember various Klipper formulas".8 This was an act of *simplification* and *cognitive offloading*—taking complex, memorable formulas and placing them in a simple, functional tool.  
2. The spreadsheet was later evolved into a web-based tool.2 This was done specifically to solve the "confusion" users experienced with the Google Sheet "Make a Copy" function.8 This action demonstrates a focus on *minimizing user friction*.  
3. Other tools, such as the "FDM Cost Calculator" and "Shrinkage Calculator" 10, are single-purpose utilities that solve one specific problem.

The brand's purpose is not to be aesthetically simple. Its purpose is to take inherently complex, non-minimal subjects (like firmware physics) and make them accessible to a wider audience by minimizing the cognitive load and practical friction required to implement them.

### **1.3 Core Values and Brand Philosophy**

The brand's content and assets are built on a consistent set of core values:

* **Practicality and Utility:** Every asset serves a distinct, practical function. Tools are created to solve specific, real-world problems for 3D printer users, such as calculating Klipper formulas 6, determining the true cost of a print 10, or providing utility-based affiliate links for the exact tools and connectors needed for a tutorial.11  
* **Thoroughness and Meticulousness:** The content eschews brevity for the sake of completeness. This is evidenced by long-form, multi-part video series (e.g., "Voron 2.4 r2 Build Guide: Part 17" 5) and "Detailed (And Boring)" written guides.1 The brand prioritizes providing the *entire* process, ensuring the user is not left with gaps.  
* **Open-Source Ethos:** The brand operates with a high degree of transparency and a commitment to open-source principles. The primary Klipper configuration repository is shared under a permissive MIT license 12, and all web-based tools and calculators are provided free of charge.10  
* **Authentic Problem-Solving:** The brand's authenticity stems from the fact that its content is a byproduct of the creator's personal projects.  
  * The Klipper Spreadsheet was created for the author's *own* use before it was shared.8  
  * The creator's Medium bio states the articles are his personal "journey of discovery".1  
  * The primary minimal3dp.com website was explicitly created to serve as the creator's personal "repository of knowledge for my work" because he found he did not "document my work well enough".2  
  * This positions the creator as a fellow enthusiast and expert who documents his solutions, rather than a top-down influencer generating content based on trends. The public-facing content is effectively a polished, shared version of the creator's personal lab notebook.

## **2.0 Content: Primary Content Pillars and Formats**

This section deconstructs the creator's content strategy based on a comprehensive analysis of the brand's public-facing output, primarily from its YouTube channel and associated social media announcements.5 These pillars define the topics the brand has established authority in.

### **2.1 Pillar 1: Klipper Firmware Implementation and Optimization**

This is the brand's foremost area of expertise. The content covers the full lifecycle of Klipper implementation:

* **Installation and Setup:** Guiding users through the installation process using tools like the Klipper Install and Update Helper (KIAUH).5  
* **Hardware-Specific Configuration:** Detailed guides on configuring Klipper for specific, popular hardware upgrades, such as "Configuring and working with Klipper after upgrading an Ender 3 v2 Neo to the Manta E3EZ Board".5  
* **Calibration and Tuning:** This is a major sub-pillar, supported by a "series of quick videos" 5 that teach users how to calibrate and optimize Klipper, often referencing the brand's own Klipper Calibration Spreadsheet and Website.5  
* **Advanced Macros and Testing:** Content that moves beyond basic setup, such as "Optimizing Klipper for speed using the Klipper Auto Speed Macro" 5 and tutorials on running speed and acceleration tests from "Ellis's Print Tuning Guide".5

### **2.2 Pillar 2: Slicer Software Tutorials and Calibration**

The brand provides deep-dive tutorials on popular slicer software, with a clear focus on OrcaSlicer as the preferred tool for advanced users.

* **Primary Slicer: OrcaSlicer:**  
  * **Settings Deep-Dives:** "Looking at Orca Slicer's Extrusion Rate Smoothing settings".5  
  * **Calibration Guides:** "OrcaSlicer Calibration and Max Flowrate" 13, which is described as a "beginner-friendly tutorial".13  
  * **Advanced Features:** "Setting up adaptive bed mesh in Orca Slicer by adding a single line of code".5  
* **Secondary Slicer: Ultimaker Cura:**  
  * **Beginner-Focused Series:** This content is explicitly framed for new users, with titles like "Mastering Ultimaker Cura in Minutes: Download and Install (A Beginner Guide \- Part 1)" and "Part 2 \- Fine-Tuning".5  
* **Comparative Analysis:**  
  * Establishing expertise by creating comparison content, such as a series comparing "Cura, PrusaSlicer, and Orca Slicer" using the \#3dBenchy test model.5

### **2.3 Pillar 3: Hardware Builds, Upgrades, and Reviews**

This pillar focuses on the physical aspects of 3D printing, documenting the creator's own hardware projects.

* **Complex Printer Builds:** These are long-form, serialized build guides. The most prominent examples are the "Voron 2.4 r2 Build Guide" and the "FormBot Voron 2.4 R2 Pro+ kit" build series.3 The serialized nature (e.g., "Part 17 \- Getting that Skirt On\!" 5) demonstrates the "thorough" brand value.  
* **Hardware Upgrades:** Step-by-step installation guides for specific components, such as "Setting up the BIQU Hermit Crab 2 (Standard) on an Ender 3 Neo Max".5  
* **Hardware Reviews:** Unboxing, initial setup, and reviews of popular ecosystem components, including the "Creality Sonic Pad" 5 and the "FixDry Double NT1" filament dryer.3

### **2.4 Pillar 4: Tool Development and Utility (Metacontent)**

This pillar consists of content *about* the brand's own tools, which serves to close the content loop and drive adoption of its web assets.

* **Announcements:** Posts and videos "Announcing the creation of The Klipper Optimization & Calibration Website".2  
* **Tutorials (Legacy):** A body of work, including videos and articles, that explains the use of the original "Klipper Calibration Spreadsheet".1

The analysis of these content pillars reveals the brand's specific target audience. While the topics are *advanced* (Klipper, Voron, slicer physics) 5, the content *framing* is explicitly for beginners: "beginner-friendly tutorial" 13, "Ultimaker Cura Made Easy".5 This defines the brand's unique market position: it is not for true beginners. Instead, its target audience is the **"Ambitious Beginner"** or **"Intermediate Upgrader"**—a user who is ready to move beyond basic stock-printer operation and wants to upgrade, tune, and optimize their hardware and firmware.

Furthermore, the content model is **Project-Driven and Serialized**. The content log is dominated by multi-part series: "Voron... Part 17," "Voron... Part 6," "Cura... Part 1," "Cura... Part 2," "Klipper... Part 2".5 This indicates that the creator's workflow is to undertake a large project (e.g., "Build a Voron") and meticulously document *every* step as a separate video. This is not a "one-off" topic-based channel; it is a project-based content library.

### **2.5 Quantitative Content Performance Analysis**

Analysis of lifetime channel analytics (as of late 2025\) provides quantitative validation of the brand's core content pillars. The channel has achieved over 1.76 million views, 88,800 hours of watch time, and 10,026 subscribers, generating over $5,636 in revenue.16 The data shows a clear correlation between content that addresses complex, high-friction technical problems and high audience engagement, watch time, and revenue.

The following tables identify the top-performing content across key metrics.16

This data provides three critical insights:

1. **Klipper is the Primary Audience Driver:** The top two videos for views and top three for subscribers are explicit Klipper guides.16 This content serves as the main funnel for attracting new viewers to the brand.  
2. **OrcaSlicer is the Primary Revenue Driver:** The "Orca Slicer 101" video is the \#1 earner and also \#1 for total watch time (3,905 hours).16 This demonstrates that the audience is highly invested and engaged with slicer-specific content.  
3. **Long-Form Content Wins:** The top 3 revenue-earning videos have an average duration of over 18 minutes (1555s, 1092s, 656s).16 This quantitatively proves that the "Detailed (And Boring)" philosophy (Section 1.3) is the brand's most valuable asset, leading to higher watch time and revenue.

## **3.0 Technical Knowledge Base: Core Domains of Expertise**

This section details the specific, verifiable technical knowledge of the Minimal 3DP brand. This forms the "ground truth" for the creator's expertise and should be used to inform all technical content creation and coding assistance.

### **3.1 Domain 1: Klipper Firmware**

Klipper is the single most important domain of expertise for Minimal 3DP. The brand's authority is built on a history of creating tools and configurations for this firmware.

#### **3.1.1 Asset Evolution and Causal Relationship**

The brand's Klipper assets demonstrate a clear, logical evolution driven by user feedback and the creator's "minimal friction" philosophy.

* **V1 (Legacy): The Klipper Calibration Spreadsheet**.1  
  * **Origin:** This Google Sheet was created for the author's personal use "to help myself keep track of and remember various Klipper formulas".8  
  * **Problem:** When shared, this tool "caused some confusion".8 Many users requested edit access to the original sheet rather than following the instruction to "Make a Copy," creating a maintenance and support burden.2  
* **V2 (Current): The Klipper Calibration Website** (minimal3dp.com/klipper-calibration).2  
  * **Origin:** This website was created as a *direct solution* to the problems of the spreadsheet.2 It "is based on" the original spreadsheet 9 but translates the formulas into interactive web-based calculators, simplifying the process and eliminating the "Make a Copy" confusion.

#### **3.1.2 Specific Klipper Knowledge**

The Klipper Calibration website 6 provides a definitive list of Klipper concepts in which the creator has documented expertise:

* **Rotation Distance:** Calculating for extruders.  
* **Lead Screw Rotation Distance:** Calculating for Z-axis lead screws.  
* **Flow Calibration:** Calibrating extruder flow within the slicer.  
* **Run Current (TMC2208/2209):** Calculating the correct run current for steppers.  
* **Pressure Advance:** Calculating the ideal Pressure Advance value.  
* **Input Shaping:** Setting up and calculating Input Shaping values.  
* **Probe Offsets:** Calculating and setting X and Y Offsets for probes.  
* **PID Tuning:** Correct procedure for running PID tunes for hotends and beds.  
* **Probe Testing:** Testing the functionality of a "Bltouch, CRTouch, ora clone" in Klipper.6  
* **Max Volumetric Speed:** (Cross-listed with OrcaSlicer) Calculating and setting this value.6

#### **3.1.3 Klipper Application Standards and Data**

The "MINIMAL3DP\_APP\_GUIDE" (manifested as a collection of spreadsheets) provides the definitive technical specification for the brand's Klipper tools and knowledge base. This data is the "ground truth" for all Klipper-related content and tools.

A. Klipper Basic Configuration Checks  
This represents a standardized checklist or tool for verifying a new Klipper installation before calibration. It includes specific processes, console commands, and troubleshooting notes.17

| Process | Commands (Use in Console) | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Verify temperature | (None) | Check that nozzle, bed, and chamber temps read ambient (e.t., 25°C). If rising or 0, power off and check wiring. |
| Verify M112 | M112, then FIRMWARE\_RESTART | Verifies emergency stop and restart capabilities. |
| Verify heaters | (UI Command) Heat Nozzle to 50 | Watch graph; temp should rise in \~30 seconds. If not, check heater\_pin. |

| Pressure Advance (OrcaSlicer) | pressure\_advance \= \<start\> \+ \<measured\_height\> \* \<step\> (Step is 0.002 for DD, 0.02 for Bowden) | 18 |
| Input Shaping (Manual) | X Frequency \= (X Rings \* Print Speed) / X Measurements (Hz) | 18 |
| X and Y Probe Offsets | X Offset \= Toolhead X Nozzle \- Toolhead X Probe | 18 |
| Max Volumetric Speed (Orca) | max flow value \= start \+ (height-measured \* step) | 18 |
| Max Volumetric Speed (Ellis) | Volumetric Flow \= Drop Off \* Filament Value (Filament Value is 2.4 for 1.75mm) | 18 |
| Lead Screw Rotation Distance | Rotation Distance \= Pitch \* \# of Threads (e.g., T8x8 is 2 \* 4 \= 8\) | 18 |
| Extrusion Rate Smoothing (ERS) | ERS (MAX) \= acceleration \* Line Width \* Line Height | 18 |
| Skew Correction | SET\_SKEW XY=..., XZ=..., YZ=... | 18 |
| OS Adaptive Pressure Advance | Records PA values at different speeds and accelerations. | 18 |

#### **3.1.4 Klipper Code Assets (GitHub)**

The creator's public GitHub repositories provide the "ground truth" for their coding style and hardware specializations.

* **Primary Repository:** github.com/minimal3dp/klipper.12  
* **Stated Purpose:** "My various Klipper configs".12  
* **License:** MIT License 12, reinforcing the open-source value.  
* **Hardware Focus:** The configs demonstrate expertise with specific, popular hardware combinations:  
  * ender3v2-skr-mini-e3-v3 (Creality Ender 3 V2 with a BigTreeTech SKR Mini E3 V3 board).12  
  * ender5plus-skr3 (Creality Ender 5 Plus with a BigTreeTech SKR 3 board).12  
  * tronxy-x5sa.12  
  * swx1 (Artillery Sidewinder X1).3  
* **Other Repositories:** Other repos on the minimal3dp GitHub profile further detail this focus, including ender3v2-klipper, voron24r2pro (a backup for a Voron 2.4 build), and k2\_powerups (a repo for testing new ideas).7

The following table summarizes the creator's public-facing code repositories, which serve as a style and specialization guide.

**Table 3.1.4: Analysis of Minimal 3DP GitHub Repositories**

| Repository Name | URL | Type | Stated Purpose / Hardware | Key Insights (from ) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| klipper | .../minimal3dp/klipper | Config | "My various Klipper configs" (Ender 3/5, SKR boards, Tronxy, SWX1) | 25 Stars, 7 Forks. The main repo. |
| Marlin | .../minimal3dp/Marlin | Fork | Fork of MarlinFirmware/Marlin. | Shows general firmware interest. |
| klipper-macros | .../minimal3d/klipper-macros | Fork | Fork of jschuh/klipper-macros. | Shows interest in community macros. |
| ender3v2-klipper | .../minimal3dp/ender3v2-klipper | Config | "Ender 3 v2 Klipper Configurations" | 3 Stars. Specific to this popular printer. |
| voron24r2pro | .../minimal3dp/voron24r2pro | Config | "Backup for my Voron 24 v2 Pro+ running an M8P Board" | Directly supports the YouTube build series. |
| k2\_powerups | .../minimal3dp/k2\_powerups | Tool/Test | "Repo to test my ideas for improving the leveling and print start for the Creality K2" | 3 Stars, 1 Fork. Active R\&D repo. |

### **3.2 Domain 2: Slicer Software (OrcaSlicer)**

The creator's secondary domain of expertise is slicer software, with a strong preference for OrcaSlicer.

* **Core Expertise:** Advanced Calibration *using* OrcaSlicer's built-in tools.13  
* **Key Concept: Max Volumetric Speed (MVS):** The creator has produced multiple pieces of content on this specific topic.6 This content defines MVS as an "automatic speed limiter for your 3D printer's filament flow" 13 and one of the "most powerful features" in modern slicers.13  
* **Core Asset: settings.minimal3dp.com:**  
  * This asset is listed in the creator's primary blurb. While research attempts found the site inaccessible 20, its stated purpose is the "OrcaSlicer Expert Assistant".20  
  * Based on the creator's established *modus operandi* of evolving spreadsheets into web tools 2, it is a high-probability inference that settings.minimal3dp.com is a web-based tool or wizard that guides users through calibration and generates OrcaSlicer settings or profiles.

#### **3.2.1 OrcaSlicer Application Standards (OrcaSlicer Recommendations)**

The "MINIMAL3DP\_APP\_GUIDE" includes a set of "OrcaSlicer Recommendations" derived from the official OrcaSlicer Wiki.21 This data represents the brand's endorsed "best practices" and default settings, forming the technical specification for the "OrcaSlicer Expert Assistant" tool.

A. OrcaSlicer Printer Settings  
These settings define machine-specific G-code and hardware interactions.21

| Setting | Recommended Value / G-Code | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Air Filtration Fan | M106 P3 | OrcaSlicer uses this command to control the filtration/exhaust fan. |
| Auxiliary Fan | M106 P2 | OrcaSlicer uses this command to control the auxiliary cooling fan. |
| Chamber Temperature | M141/M191 | OrcaSlicer uses these commands to control an active chamber heater. |
| Adaptive Bed Mesh (Klipper) | BED\_MESH\_CALIBRATE mesh\_min=... mesh\_max=... ALGORITHM=... PROBE\_COUNT=... ADAPTIVE=0 ADAPTIVE\_MARGIN=0 | The APP\_GUIDE explicitly notes to pass ADAPTIVE\_MARGIN=0 as Orca handles this internally, and ADAPTIVE=0 to prevent Klipper's own logic from interfering. |
| Adaptive Bed Mesh (Marlin) | G29 L{adaptive\_bed\_mesh\_min} R{adaptive\_bed\_mesh\_max} F{adaptive\_bed\_mesh\_min1} B{adaptive\_bed\_mesh\_max1} T V4 | Notes that Marlin doesn't yet support probe count. |

B. OrcaSlicer Quality Settings  
These settings define the core printing parameters for quality and precision, based on the OrcaSlicer Wiki.\[29, 29\]

| Setting | Recommended Value | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Layer Height (Min-Max) | 20-80% (of Nozzle Width) | Example: 0.4mm Nozzle \-\> 0.32mm Max |
| First Layer Height | 50-65% (of Nozzle Width) | Example: 0.4mm Nozzle \-\> 0.24mm (60%) |
| Line Widths (Default) | 105-150% | Example: 0.5mm |
| Line Widths (Outer Wall) | 105-150% | Example: 0.6mm |
| Line Widths (Inner Wall) | \>= 120% | Example: 0.5mm |
| Line Widths (Top Surface) | 100-105% | Example: 0.42mm |
| Seam Position | Aligned, Back, or Random | "Random" is noted as strongest; "Aligned" or "Back" are best for visuals. |
| Staggered inner seams | On | Noted for stronger, more water-tight models. |
| Arc fitting | Off (for Klipper), On (for Marlin) | Klipper does not benefit as it splits arcs back into segments. |
| Precise wall | On | Improves size accuracy and layer consistency. |
| Walls printing order | Inner/Outer/Inner | Recommended in most cases for best external finish. |
| Avoid crossing walls | On | "Highly recommended" for detailed prints, especially with PETG/TPU. |
| Thick bridges | Enable for Internal Bridges | Improves reliability; may result in a rougher surface. |

C. OrcaSlicer Strength Settings  
This section defines settings related to part strength.21

| Setting | Recommended Value | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Infill/Wall Overlap | 25-30% (Top/Bottom Shells) | For better bonding and to minimize pinholes.21 |
| Infill Wall Overlap | 10-15% (Sparse Infill) | Minimizes over-extrusion and rough surfaces.21 |

### **3.3 Domain 3: Utility Calculators**

This domain reinforces the "functional minimalism" brand value. These tools are hosted on the main minimal3dp.com website.10

* **FDM Cost Calculator:** This tool calculates the "true cost" of a 3D print, moving beyond just filament weight to include the costs of "electricity and time".10  
* **Shrinkage Calculator:** A practical utility "to compensate for material shrinkage in your prints".10

## **4.0 Ecosystem: Digital Assets and Platform Architecture**

This section maps the complete digital footprint of the Minimal 3DP brand, defining the specific function of each platform and their interconnections. This represents the "schema" of the brand's operations.

### **4.1 Primary Domain and Hub: minimal3dp.com**

This is the central, owned hub of the Minimal 3DP brand.

* **Technology:** The site is built with **Hugo**, a static site generator, and uses the **Docsy theme**.2  
* **Origin and Rationale:** The creator explicitly states that this site replaces a previous WordPress implementation.2 The move was driven by the fact that WordPress was "cumbersome," a "pain" to maintain, and a significant security risk ("it seemed like someone was always trying to hack it").2  
* This platform choice is a critical, brand-defining action. The creator, a technical user, faced common WordPress issues (bloat, security) and chose a solution (Hugo) that is fast, highly secure (no database, non-executable files), and managed via code and text (the creator notes using "Textastic" on his iPhone to update the site 2). This choice is a perfect physical expression of the "Minimal 3DP" brand values: functional minimalism, security, and a preference for code-based, developer-centric solutions.

### **4.2 Content Platforms**

These are the platforms used for content delivery and audience building.

* **YouTube (Primary):** youtube.com/channel/UCM\_8Mv-0S1LnnJpRJLjahaw.22 This is the primary top-of-funnel and main content delivery platform. All other platforms, such as Facebook and the website's blog, primarily exist to support and drive traffic *to* the YouTube content.5  
* **Medium (Legacy):** minimal3dp.medium.com.1 This appears to be a *legacy* platform for text-based articles. The latest cited articles are from February 2023 1, while the new Hugo-based website and blog were announced in April 2024\.2 This signals a clear strategic migration from a "rented" platform (Medium) to a fully "owned" platform (minimal3dp.com).

### **4.3 Tool Platforms**

These are the web applications that deliver on the brand's "utility" promise.

* **Active Web Tools:**  
  * minimal3dp.com/klipper-calibration: The suite of Klipper web-based calculators.6  
  * minimal3dp.com: The main domain, which hosts the FDM Cost and Shrinkage calculators.10  
* **Inferred Web Tool:**  
  * settings.minimal3dp.com: The "OrcaSlicer Expert Assistant".20  
* **Legacy Tool (Source):**  
  * The original Google Sheet (docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1...) that served as the prototype for the Klipper web tools.8

### **4.4 Code Repositories**

* **Platform:** github.com/minimal3dp.7  
* **Function:** This platform serves as the open-source "proof of work" for the brand's technical expertise. It provides configuration backups, shares code, and allows for community collaboration and feedback via forks and issues.7 (See **Table 3.1.4** for a full breakdown).

### **4.5 Community and Distribution Channels**

This category includes platforms used for audience interaction and content distribution.

#### **4.5.1 Facebook Page (Distribution Channel)**

* **Platform:** facebook.com/minimal3DP.5  
* **Function:** A content analysis of this page 5 reveals its sole function is as a **Distribution Channel**, not a *Community Hub*. The feed consists entirely of posts that link to new YouTube videos, accompanied by "brief descriptions" of the video.5 There is no evidence of user-generated content, discussions, or other community-building activities. Its purpose is to drive traffic *to* YouTube.

#### **4.5.2 Strategic Recommendation: Discord Community Hub**

* **Analysis:** Analysis of the brand's assets (Section 4.5.1) and target audience (Section 2.4) reveals a significant gap in community infrastructure. The Facebook page operates as a one-way distribution channel, not a two-way community hub.5  
* **Recommendation:** A proprietary, branded Discord server is the natural solution to fill this gap. It directly aligns with the brand's "utility" value by providing a real-time, peer-to-peer technical support hub for the "Ambitious Beginner" audience engaging with complex Klipper and OrcaSlicer topics.  
* **Integration Strategy:** To avoid becoming "cumbersome" (a key friction point for the creator 2), the server should be launched with a minimal, "functional" channel structure mapped to the brand's core content pillars (Klipper, OrcaSlicer, Hardware).16 It must be integrated into the "Ecosystem Loop" (Section 6.2) not only as a destination for support but as a source for identifying high-friction user problems that will fuel future "Detailed (and Boring)" video content.

### **4.6 Project: 3D Printer Start Guide**

The "MINIMAL3DP\_APP\_GUIDE" data identifies a new project or asset in development: the "3D Printer Start Guide".25 This appears to be a structured, comprehensive resource for new users, broken down into key pillars.\[30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30\] The planned sections include:

* 3D Printing Overview (Types of 3D Printers) 25  
* Building a Printer 25  
* Slicers 25  
* Filament 25  
* Calibration 25  
* Model Sites 25  
* 3D Benchy 25

## **5.0 Monetization: Support and Revenue Channels**

This section defines how the brand is financially supported. This dictates the handling of calls-to-action and required legal disclosures.

### **5.1 Primary Channel: Affiliate Links**

* **Program:** Amazon Services LLC Associates Program.11  
* **Usage:** Links are placed in YouTube video descriptions.11  
* **Disclosure:** This is a **strict and non-negotiable brand rule**. The creator *always* includes an explicit, bolded disclaimer: "\*\* Amazon links are Affiliate Links " 11 or " Links are Amazon Affiliate Links \*\*".26 All AI-generated content must include this exact phrasing whenever Amazon links are present.

The brand's affiliate strategy is "Utility-Based," not "Sales-Based." An analysis of the links used 11 shows they are not for high-ticket items (like 3D printers) but for small, specific, necessary components and tools *mentioned in the tutorial itself*. Examples include "Wire Flush Cutters," "JST Connector Kit" 11, "Solderless Power Clip on Connector" 27, and "Threaded Inserts".26 This tactic transforms the affiliate link from a "sales pitch" into a "utility" or "bill of materials" for the viewer, which directly reinforces the core brand values of practicality and helpfulness.

### **5.2 Direct Support Channel (One-Time)**

* **Platform:** ko-fi.com/minimal3dp.28  
* **Function:** This platform serves as the brand's "tip jar" for one-time, passive donations. It is ideal for casual viewers who wish to show appreciation without a recurring commitment. This complements the recurring membership model.

### **5.3 Strategic Recommendation: Recurring Membership (Patreon)**

* **Analysis:** Lifetime data for YouTube Memberships shows this "on-platform" solution has had "limited luck," failing to gain traction (peaking at 1-2 members).16 This is due to a value mismatch: the perks (badges, emoji) offer no *utility* to the brand's technical, "Ambitious Beginner" audience.  
* **Recommendation:** A hybrid monetization model is required. The primary hub for recurring support should be **Patreon**, which is platform-agnostic and can be promoted across the entire ecosystem (YouTube, GitHub, Discord, and the minimal3dp.com website).  
  * **Patreon (Core Hub):** This platform allows for robust, utility-based perks that align with the brand's open-source and "repository of knowledge" values. It also has lower fees (8-12%) than YouTube (30%) and offers automatic Discord role integration, which is a high-value, low-effort perk.  
  * **YouTube Memberships (Convenience Tier):** This should be maintained as a single, low-cost (e.g., $1.99) tier. Its sole purpose is to capture casual supporters who prefer the convenience of not leaving the YouTube platform.  
* **Brand-Aligned Tier Structure (Patreon):** A successful strategy requires offering perks based on *access* and *recognition*, not paywalled content.

| Tier | Example Price | Value Proposition | Recommended Perks |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Supporter** | $2/month | Recognition & Community | "Supporter" Discord Role; Name in video credits; Vote on future content. |
| **Pro Maker** | $5/month | Early Access & Behind-the-Scenes | All previous perks; "Pro Maker" Discord Role (with private channel access); Early access to new YouTube videos; Access to "The Lab" (in-development configs, .step files for tutorial models). |
| **Ecosystem Developer** | $10-20/month | Direct Access & Influence | All previous perks; Monthly private Q\&A live stream (a "hot seat" for technical support); "Special Thanks" in GitHub README.md files. |

## **6.0 Style Guide: AI-Assist Directives for Content and Code**

This final section operationalizes all previous analysis into a concrete set of rules and directives for an LLM assistant to ensure brand consistency in all generated content and code.

### **6.1 Tone and Voice**

* **Primary:** Educational, approachable, and "beginner-friendly".5 Language must be clear, direct, and simple, even when explaining complex topics.  
* **Secondary:** Meticulous, thorough, and "Detailed (And Boring)".1 This is a key feature, not a bug. The brand voice must be *proud* of its thoroughness. Accuracy and completeness must be prioritized over brevity or entertainment.  
* **Ethos:** The voice is guided by the "Journey of Discovery" 1 and "Repository of Knowledge" 2 principles.  
  * **Directive:** Frame content from the perspective of "I am documenting my process for my own records, and I am sharing it with you."  
  * **Example (Good):** "I've been working on my Voron 2.4 build, and I needed to figure out the best way to handle the wiring. Here is the detailed process I developed and am using for my own records."  
  * **Example (Bad):** "You'll never believe this one weird trick to wire your Voron\!" (Avoid all hyperbole and clickbait phrasing).

### **6.2 Content Generation (Video/Blog)**

* **Hook/Structure:** Content should follow a consistent problem/solution/process structure.  
  1. **Problem:** Start with a common, frustrating user problem. (e.g., "Stop printing with gaps and blobs\!" 13).  
  2. **Solution:** Introduce the tool, hardware, or process as the specific solution. (e.g., "Master your flow rate with OrcaSlicer's built-in Max Flow Rate Calibration Test" 13).  
  3. **Process:** Provide a "step-by-step" 13 or "Part X of Y" 5 serialized guide.  
* **Directives (The "Ecosystem Loop"):** No piece of content should exist in isolation. It must be woven into the entire Minimal 3DP ecosystem.  
  * A YouTube video must link to the relevant Klipper tool.13  
  * A Facebook post must link to the new YouTube video.5  
  * A blog post must link to the Klipper tools and relevant GitHub files.2  
  * A YouTube tutorial must link to the Amazon affiliate products for the parts used.11  
  * **AI Directive:** The AI's primary job in content generation is to be the "connective tissue." A single YouTube description draft, for example, must include:  
    1. The standard blurb (Tools, Community, Support) as a footer.  
    2. *Specific* links to the tools used (e.g., minimal3dp.com/klipper-calibration/pressure-advance).  
    3. *Specific* links to the GitHub config file if relevant (e.g., .../klipper/ender3v2.../printer.cfg).  
    4. Utility-based Amazon Affiliate links for all parts/tools used (e.g., "JST connectors I used: \[amzn link\]").  
    5. The mandatory affiliate disclosure.

### **6.3 Coding Assistance (Klipper/Web)**

* **Goal:** Simplicity, maintainability, and functional minimalism.  
* **Klipper Configs:**  
  * **AI Directive:** When asked to write a Klipper macro or config file, the creator's existing GitHub repositories 7 must be used as the *primary style guide*. Code must be heavily commented, explaining the *reason* for each setting, not just *what* it does.  
* **Web Tools (Hugo/JavaScript):**  
  * **AI Directive:** When asked to create a new tool, it must follow the established pattern:  
    1. It must solve *one* specific, formula-based problem (like the calculators in 6).  
    2. It must be a web-based evolution of a manual process or spreadsheet (like the evolution from 8 to 2).  
    3. It must be deployable on a Hugo static site (e.g., self-contained HTML/JavaScript that can be dropped into a page).

### **6.4 Brand Consistency Rules (Non-Negotiable)**

* **Brand Name:** Minimal 3DP.  
* **Creator Name:** Michael "Mike" Wilson.1  
* **Affiliate Disclosure:** *Always* include the explicit, bolded disclosure when Amazon links are present: "\*\* Links are Amazon Affiliate Links \*\*".11  
* **Content Footer:** All primary content (YouTube descriptions, blog posts) must end with the full, structured blurb provided by the user (listing Tools, Community, and Support channels).  
* **Discord:** Refer to the Discord as a community "on Discord" or "the community," not "my Discord."

### **6.5 Data-Driven Content Recommendations**

Based on the quantitative performance analysis in Section 2.5, all future content generation should be prioritized based on the following data-validated recommendations.

* **Double-Down on Klipper as the Core Funnel:** Klipper-focused content is the brand's primary driver of new views and subscribers.16 Content should continue to target specific, high-friction Klipper tasks, such as installation (zzFxnu3Liyo) and complex calibrations like Z-Offset (4Y35XzPKjUs), as these have the highest proven search performance.  
* **Amplify OrcaSlicer as the High-Value Pillar:** The OrcaSlicer calibration video (yky7D0nBeGw) is the channel's top-performing asset for both revenue and watch time.16 This indicates the audience is highly engaged and willing to watch long, detailed content on this topic. Future strategy should include more serialized "deep dive" content on OrcaSlicer and heavily cross-promote the settings.minimal3dp.com ("OrcaSlicer Expert Assistant") tool within these videos to convert engaged viewers into tool users.  
* **Target the "Intermediate Upgrader":** Videos covering high-value, specific hardware and firmware upgrades (e.g., mriscoc's firmware, BTT SKR boards, CoreXY conversions like the Mercury 1.1) show strong performance in both revenue and subscriber conversion.16 This confirms the target audience is the "Ambitious Beginner" (Section 2.4) and content should continue to serve this user's journey.  
* **Embrace and Promote Long-Form, Detailed Content:** The channel's top-earning videos are long, with an average duration of over 18 minutes.16 This directly validates the "Thoroughness and Meticulousness" brand value (Section 1.3). The brand's "Detailed (and Boring)" style is a key feature, not a bug, and should be the default format for all "Pillar" content, as it maximizes watch time, which in turn drives revenue and audience loyalty.
