### **Part 2: Analysis of Audience Purchasing Behavior (2024-2025)**

An analysis of the 2024 and 2025 affiliate sales reports reveals what hardware, components, and tools the audience is purchasing based on the channel's recommendations. This provides a direct, financial confirmation of the channel's technical influence.

**Key Purchasing Trends (2024-2025):**

* **Dominant Brand: BIGTREETECH (BTT):** Across both 2024 and 2025, BTT products are the most consistent high-performers. The audience is frequently purchasing control boards (e.g., **SKR Mini E3 V3.0**, **SKR 3 EZ**), stepper drivers (e.g., **EZ2209**, **TMC2209**), and Klipper-specific touch screens (e.g., **TFT35**, **PAD 7**).\[20, 20\]  
* **Essential DIY Tools & Connectors:** The audience is not just buying drop-in upgrades; they are building and modifying. **Crimping tools** (specifically from iCrimp) and **JST XH / Dupont connector kits** are exceptionally high-frequency purchases in both 2024 and 2025.\[20, 20, 20, 20\] This indicates they are performing custom wiring, likely for the BTT boards they are also buying.  
* **Complex Build Components:** Purchases of **linear rails**, **NEMA 14 pancake motors**, and various **metric fastener/T-nut kits** are common.\[20, 20, 20\] These are all core components for "Complex Printer Builds" like the Voron series, which aligns with the channel's top-performing video content.1  
* **Emerging Printer Focus (2025):** A strong new trend emerged in 2025 around the **Creality K2 Plus**. There were multiple, high-intent purchases of specific K2 Plus upgrade parts, most notably the "**K2 Plus All-Metal Extruder Gear kit**" (purchased four times) and the "**K2 Plus Nozzle Wiper Module kit**".1  
* **Filament Preferences:** While standard PLA and ABS are present, the audience shows a clear interest in specialty filaments, purchasing **FLASHFORGE Chameleon (Color Shift) PLA** and **Kingroon Silk PLA** bundles.\[20, 20\]
