# Setting Max Volumentric Speed

## From Orca Slicer

> This is a test designed to calibrate the maximum volumetric speed of the specific filament. The generic or 3rd party filament types may not have the correct volumetric flow rate set in the filament. This test will help you to find the maximum volumetric speed of the filament.

[Max Volumetric speed](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/Calibration#max-volumetric-speed)


## Steps

1. Open Orca Slicer
2. Go to "Calibration" -> "More..." -> "Max Flowrate
3. Fill out "Max volumetric speed test" dialog
4. Print model
5. Measure with Calipers to spot on model before the print starts to fail
6. Paste Max Flow Value into Orca Slicer Filament Section
