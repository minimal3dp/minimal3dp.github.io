# Klipper Calibration

A while ago, I create the my [Klipper Calibration Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LlSHsa86RuT_btswmDsmQp0LrTJ9U0HJcRhorsqz1ug/edit?usp=sharing) to help myself keep track of and remember various Klipper formulas to tune and improve my 3D prints. I decided to share the tools and i have received lots of requests to share the Spreadsheet. Rather than giving everyone access to edit my original sheet, I have recommended to everyone to "Make a Copy" of the sheet for their personal use. In a lot of cases this has caused some confusion. By making a copy, there is no way to any edits or updates I do to the tools.

Because of this (and my desire to do a little programming), I have put together the [Klipper Calibration Website](https://minimal3dp.com/klipper-calibration/). The standalone site gives me an opportunity to create some useful tools and program. It also give me a way to create more detailed documentation and video links.

Another hope is that, because I am using [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/), I can use the tie-ins with GitHub to allow the community to comment, make suggestions, and give feedback. I could than further refine the tools. It is my hope that this site will continue to evolve over time and include additional tools.
