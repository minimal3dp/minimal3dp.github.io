M3DP Tutorials
{{% /pageinfo %}}

These are the tutorials I have created over the years. I have tried to create [playlists on YouTube](youtube.com/channel/UCM_8Mv-0S1LnnJpRJLjahaw?sub_confirmation=1). My focus is 3D printing slicers, Klipper, and Marlin setups. I also do a lot of videos on repairing 3D printers. I am always looking for new ideas. Don't hesitate to reach out with some suggestions.
