As I plan projects, I wanted a place where I could gather my thoughts and plans. I also want to start keeping project journals.

It usually takes me a while to work on my various projects. I store references all over the place. I am hoping that this could be a place for me to gather everything. As I work in a project, I would like to be able to document the process. 

I have alot of projects planned for Minimal 3DP. I look forward to getting to work and sharing.
