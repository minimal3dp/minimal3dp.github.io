As I am putting together this site, I thought it was important to try to document my projects.

For the most part I will try to document each project as I put it together. This will include references, tools, printers, settings, and anything else I need to remember. 

This site is built with Hugo. I am utilizing the Docsy theme by Google. As a side note, I have found it easy to use and I like the documentation.
