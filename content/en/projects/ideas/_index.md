As I plan projects, I wanted a place where I could gather my thoughts and plans 
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Unfortunately, it usually takes me a while to work on my various projects. I store references all over the place. I am hoping that this could be a place for me to gather everything. 

I actually have alot of projects planned for Minimal 3DP. I look forward to getting to work and sharing.
