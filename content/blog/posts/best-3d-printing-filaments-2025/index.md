## PLA Filaments

PLA (Polylactic Acid) is the most popular 3D printing filament for good reason: it's easy to print, doesn't require a heated bed, and produces minimal odor. Perfect for beginners and decorative prints.

### Best Standard PLA

{{< amazon-product 
  asin="B07XG3RM58" 
  title="SUNLU PLA 3D Printer Filament" 
  price="$13.99" >}}

**Best budget choice.** SUNLU's PLA offers exceptional value with excellent layer adhesion and dimensional accuracy. At under $14/kg, it's my go-to for everyday printing.

**Pros:** Affordable, consistent diameter, great color selection  
**Cons:** Slightly more brittle than premium brands  
**Best for:** Prototypes, decorative prints, learning

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the best filament for beginners?**  
A: Standard PLA. It's affordable, easy to print, and doesn't require a heated bed. Start with SUNLU PLA ($13.99) for best value.

**Q: Can I print PETG without an enclosure?**  
A: Yes! PETG prints well without enclosure, unlike ABS/ASA. Just use 70-80°C bed temp and minimal cooling.

**Q: Do I need a special nozzle for carbon fiber filaments?**  
A: Yes, hardened steel nozzle is essential. Brass will wear out quickly from abrasive CF particles.

**Q: How long does filament last in storage?**  
A: PLA/PLA+: 1-2 years if kept dry. PETG/Nylon: 6-12 months. Always use desiccant in storage.

**Q: Why is my nylon print brittle?**  
A: Most likely moisture absorption. Dry your nylon for 8-12 hours at 70-80°C before printing.

**Q: Can I mix brands/materials?**  
A: Yes for same material type (different PLA brands work fine together). No for different materials in same print without proper interface settings.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right filament depends on your specific application:

- **Just starting out?** SUNLU PLA ($13.99)
- **Need strength?** eSUN PLA+ ($20.99)
