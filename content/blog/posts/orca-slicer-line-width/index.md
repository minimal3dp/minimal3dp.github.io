## Level Up Your Prints: Why Line Width is Your 3D Printing Secret Weapon

Hey everyone! In my latest video, I dove deep into a 3D printing setting that often gets overlooked but makes a massive difference in your final prints: **line width**. For a long time, I was all about chasing faster print times, but I’ve come to realize that optimizing for quality and strength is well worth a few extra minutes – and line width is a key player in achieving just that \[[00:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0jb12SLRrU&t=35)\].

**What I Learned (and You Should Too!):**

One of the biggest takeaways for me was just how much line width impacts the strength of your parts. Think about it: wider lines mean more material is laid down and there’s greater overlap between those lines, especially when it comes to printing walls. This significantly reduces those annoying little voids and makes your prints much more structurally sound \[[01:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0jb12SLRrU&t=85)\], \[[03:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0jb12SLRrU&t=186)\].

In the video, I specifically explored the line width settings within Orca Slicer. It’s pretty cool how much control you have, with options for the default width, the first layer, outer walls, and even the top surface \[[01:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0jb12SLRrU&t=98)\].

Through my research (and a bit of trial and error!), I found that for a standard 0.4mm nozzle, bumping up the default line width to around 0.5mm (that’s 125%) seems to be a sweet spot. This aligns with recommendations in the Orca Slicer wiki and what others in the community are finding \[[05:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0jb12SLRrU&t=310)\].

The best part? I was genuinely surprised at how little impact these adjustments had on the overall print time. The test print I showed in the video only took about 7 seconds longer with the optimized settings \[[10:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0jb12SLRrU&t=606)\]. That’s a tiny trade-off for a noticeable improvement in quality!

Speaking of quality, I was really happy with how much cleaner the top surface looked after making these changes. You could see a real difference in how those layers blended together, resulting in fewer visible lines \[[11:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0jb12SLRrU&t=682)\].

Oh, and here’s a little bonus tip I shared in the video: if you’re struggling with removing support material, try using a slightly thinner line width (smaller than your nozzle diameter) for your support structures. It makes them much easier to break away \[[08:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0jb12SLRrU&t=517)\].

**Give it a Shot!**

Ultimately, what I wanted to show in this video is that taking the time to dial in your line width settings is well worth the effort. It’s all about finding that balance between print speed, the quality of your finished product, and the overall strength of your 3D prints \[[12:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0jb12SLRrU&t=753)\].
