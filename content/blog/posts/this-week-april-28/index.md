## Orca Slicer Tutorials

I am working to add to my Orca Slicer tutorials th ok s week. i want to do a post on ideal settings for support (based on a viewer question) and do a video on my recommendation for seam settings.

## STEM Outreach

As part of my job, I sometimes do STEM outreach with local schools. This usually involves taking a 3D printer and talking to kids (and parents) about STEM careers. Before I go to an event, I have gotten into the habit of 3D printing a bunch of print-in-place and flexi animals to give out. This week I am hoping to print 100 animals.
