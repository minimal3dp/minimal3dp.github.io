# The Week of April 28st 2024

I am currently working on several projects this week. They include:

- [Voron 2.4 R2 Pro+ Build](https://minimal3dp.com/projects/ideas/voron-2.4-r2/)
- [Belt Driven Ender 3](https://kevinakasam.com/belt-driven-ender-3/)
- Orca Slicer Seam Settings
- STEM Outreach

## Voron 2.4 R2 Pro+ Build

I have started getting together my project website for my Voron build. One of the newer ideas I am trying is to create a project website. I am hoping that it makes it easier for me to save references and other links. I typically try to research a project before I begin and it will make it to asier to share my research.

With the Voron build, I have mostly saved basic references from the [Voron site](https://vorondesign.com/). I have also saved doc from the FormBot site. They appear to have some updated instructions for their kits.

## Belt Driven Ender 3

I stumbled across this project a while ago. It seemed like an interesting conversion for my Ender 3 v2. This week I am going to work on adding a project website and printing the needed parts. The hardware cost less than $30 USD.

## STEM Outreach

As part of my job, I sometimes do STEM outreach with local schools. This usually involves taking a 3D printer and talking to kids (and parents) about STEM careers. Before I go to an event, I have gotten into the habit of 3D printing a bunch of print-in-place and flexi animals to give out. This week I am hoping to print 100 animals.
