&lt;p>With my previous website, I put it together with Wordpress. As what typically happens, WordPress was just too cumbersome for me to maintain. Additionally, it seemed like someone was always trying to hack it. It was a pain and I worried about the hacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have used Hugo in the past and I thought I would try to rewrite the site in it. I liked the Docsy theme but I was not sure I could create the Klipper Calibration website. It turns out it was easier that I thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="klipper-calibration">Klipper Calibration&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#klipper-calibration" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of my main goals for creating this site, is the Klipper Calibration calculators I have put together. I have my &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LlSHsa86RuT_btswmDsmQp0LrTJ9U0HJcRhorsqz1ug/edit?usp=sharing">Klipper Calibration Spreadsheet&lt;/a> but many people are requesting edit access. To simplify things, I thought it would be a good idea to create these online tools. It also gave me the opportunity to do some simple programming. It has been a while.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because I am using Docsy, there are tools built in to leave comments and post issues on github. I thought this integration would be helpful as I tried to improve and expand the tools. I am looking forward to the feedback. I know that there is room for improvement.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="projects">Projects&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#projects" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To many time I do not document my work well enough. I have several different tools for reference and documentation. Because it is &lt;em>several different&lt;/em> tools, I never know where to look. With this in mind, I am hoping this site can serve as a repository of knowledge for my work. I sometime wish I had more time. There are so many cool ideas to try. Hopefully, I will have a chance to explore.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="blog">Blog&lt;a class="td-heading-self-link" href="#blog" aria-label="Heading self-link">&lt;/a>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The blog is a minor feature for me. I always have good intentions for keeping it up but I always have trouble finding the time. We will see how this iteration goes. I am thinking that Hugo will make it easy. A lot of content here was done via my iPhone. Working Copy and Textastic are amazing apps and worth every penny.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: This Week on Minimal 3DP (April 28)</title><link>https://minimal3dp.com/blog/2024/04/28/this-week-on-minimal-3dp-april-28/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://minimal3dp.com/blog/2024/04/28/this-week-on-minimal-3dp-april-28/</guid><description>

&lt;p>I am currently working on several projects this week. They include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://minimal3dp.com/projects/ideas/voron-2.4-r2/">Voron 2.4 R2 Pro+ Build&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Orca Slicer Seam Settings&lt;/li>

&lt;p>i recordedcan unboxing video on Sunday and I have begun building the Voron this week. I am working myvway through the assembly manual and wiol drop a vireo of rrame assembly next weekend.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I am working to add to my Orca Slicer tutorials th ok s week. i want to do a post on ideal settings for support (based on a viewer question) and do a video on my recommendation for seam settings.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As part of my job, I sometimes do STEM outreach with local schools. This usually involves taking a 3D printer and talking to kids (and parents) about STEM careers. Before I go to an event, I have gotten into the habit of 3D printing a bunch of print-in-place and flexi animals to give out. This week I am hoping to print 100 animals.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: This Week on Minimal 3DP (April 21)</title><link>https://minimal3dp.com/blog/2024/04/21/this-week-on-minimal-3dp-april-21/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://minimal3dp.com/blog/2024/04/21/this-week-on-minimal-3dp-april-21/</guid><description>

&lt;p>I have started getting together my project website for my Voron build. One of the newer ideas I am trying is to create a project website. I am hoping that it makes it easier for me to save references and other links. I typically try to research a project before I begin and it will make it to asier to share my research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the Voron build, I have mostly saved basic references from the &lt;a href="https://vorondesign.com/">Voron site&lt;/a>. I have also saved doc from the FormBot site. They appear to have some updated instructions for their kits.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I stumbled across this project a while ago. It seemed like an interesting conversion for my Ender 3 v2. This week I am going to work on adding a project website and printing the needed parts. The hardware cost less than $30 USD.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A while ago, I create the my &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LlSHsa86RuT_btswmDsmQp0LrTJ9U0HJcRhorsqz1ug/edit?usp=sharing">Klipper Calibration Spreadsheet&lt;/a> to help myself keep track of and remember various Klipper formulas to tune and improve my 3D prints. I decided to share the tools and i have received lots of requests to share the Spreadsheet. Rather than giving everyone access to edit my original sheet, I have recommended to everyone to &amp;ldquo;Make a Copy&amp;rdquo; of the sheet for their personal use. In a lot of cases this has caused some confusion. By making a copy, there is no way to any edits or updates I do to the tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of this (and my desire to do a little programming), I have put together the &lt;a href="https://minimal3dp.com/klipper-calibration/">Klipper Calibration Website&lt;/a>. The standalone site gives me an opportunity to create some useful tools and program. It also give me a way to create more detailed documentation and video links.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another hope is that, because I am using &lt;a href="https://www.docsy.dev/">Docsy&lt;/a>, I can use the tie-ins with GitHub to allow the community to comment, make suggestions, and give feedback. I could than further refine the tools. It is my hope that this site will continue to evolve over time and include additional tools.&lt;/p>
