The best way to get an accurate value for this setting is to use a &amp;ldquo;measure and trim&amp;rdquo; procedure.
First start with an initial guess for the rotation distance. This may be obtained from steps_per_mm or by inspecting the hardware.
Then use the following procedure to &amp;ldquo;measure and trim&amp;rdquo;:</description></item><item><title>Flow Calibration</title><link>https://minimal3dp.com/klipper-calibration/flow-calibration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://minimal3dp.com/klipper-calibration/flow-calibration/</guid><description>Flow Calibration From 3D Print Beginner The flow rate calibration is done in order to fine tune the amount of plastic extruded by the printer. Also known as Extrusion Multiplier, by calibrating the flow rate you can fix issues caused by under-extrusion or over-extrusion. Besides this, flow rate calibration can also improve retraction values a bit and help with bulging corners and layer seam. If the extruder steps are properly calibrated, the flow rate value should be really close to a single digit value (1.</description></item><item><title>Run Current for TMC2208/2209</title><link>https://minimal3dp.com/klipper-calibration/run-current/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://minimal3dp.com/klipper-calibration/run-current/</guid><description>Run Current From the Voron Docs Calculating Currents - To calculate the maximum Klipper current settings for a given stepper, follow this process: Look up the specifications for the stepper motor and locate the peak current limits of the motor. Multiply the peak current by 0.707 to determine the maximum current in RMS. This is the maximum run current.

Basic tuning requires measuring the ringing frequencies of the printer by printing a test model.
According to the Klipper docs, slice the ringing test model, which can be found in docs/prints/ringing_tower.stl, in the slicer:

What is PID Tuning? PID stands for Proportional-Integral-Derivative. It&amp;rsquo;s a method that helps the printer controller adjust heating power based on the difference between the desired temperature (setpoint) and the actual temperature reading from the sensor.</description></item><item><title>New Minimal 3DP Website</title><link>https://minimal3dp.com/blog/2024/04/29/new-minimal-3dp-website/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://minimal3dp.com/blog/2024/04/29/new-minimal-3dp-website/</guid><description>Minimal 3DP YouTube Banner Photo: Mike Wilson / CC-BY-CA New Website With my previous website, I put it together with Wordpress.
