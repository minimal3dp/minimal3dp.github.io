<h3 id="the-relentless-pursuit-of-perfection">The Relentless Pursuit of Perfection</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;re constantly on the lookout for the latest and greatest features to elevate your 3D prints from good to flawless.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a> This relentless pursuit of perfection is the lifeblood of the 3D printing community, and it&rsquo;s a spirit embodied by the team behind OrcaSlicer. More than just a piece of software, OrcaSlicer has established itself as a dynamic, open-source project at the vanguard of Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technology.<a href="https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer">2</a> It&rsquo;s a slicer built by and for the community, characterized by a rapid development cycle that consistently delivers powerful, cutting-edge tools into our hands.</p>
<p>It is in this spirit of continuous innovation that the developers have released OrcaSlicer version 2.3.1 Alpha.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a> This isn&rsquo;t just a minor update; it&rsquo;s a significant leap forward, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of slicing. This release is packed with enhancements that promise to refine our workflows and improve our print quality in tangible ways.</p>
<h3 id="a-glimpse-of-the-future-whats-new-in-version-231-alpha">A Glimpse of the Future: What&rsquo;s New in Version 2.3.1 Alpha?</h3>
<p>The 2.3.1 Alpha release is a treasure trove of new functionalities that address various aspects of the printing process. While this guide will focus on one revolutionary feature, it&rsquo;s worth taking a moment to appreciate the breadth of improvements included in this update.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a> The key additions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new sparse infill rotation system for stronger, more efficient internal structures.</li>
<li>Substantial changes and improvements to the fuzzy skin feature, offering more creative control over surface textures.</li>
<li>Integrated input shaping calibration for printers running Klipper firmware.</li>

<li>And, the focus of our deep dive today, a completely redesigned and more intuitive method for flow rate calibration.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these features deserves its own detailed exploration, and I plan to cover them in future articles and videos. However, the new flow calibration method represents such a fundamental shift in approach and offers such a significant improvement in accuracy and ease of use that it warrants a dedicated, comprehensive guide. My goal here is to provide a focused, exhaustive walkthrough that will empower you to master this new tool immediately, without wasting your time.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a></p>

<h3 id="the-philosophy-of-alpha-releases-in-open-source">The Philosophy of Alpha Releases in Open Source</h3>
<p>Before we dive into the technical details, it&rsquo;s important to understand the context of an &ldquo;Alpha&rdquo; release. In the world of open-source software, an alpha version is far more than just an early, potentially unstable preview. It represents a philosophical choice that lies at the heart of community-driven development.<a href="https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer">2</a> Unlike the closed, internal testing of proprietary software, a public alpha is a transparent invitation for the most engaged users to become active participants in the development process.</p>
<p>The OrcaSlicer project thrives on this collaborative model, offering not just stable releases but also &ldquo;Nightly Builds&rdquo; for those who want to test the absolute latest code.<a href="https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer">2</a> When you download and use OrcaSlicer 2.3.1 Alpha, you are not merely a consumer; you are a collaborator. The feedback you provide, particularly through well-documented bug reports, is invaluable data that helps the developers refine, debug, and perfect these new features before they are rolled into a stable release.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a> This guide will not only show you how to use the new flow calibration but also how to responsibly contribute back to the project that provides these powerful tools for free.</p>
<h2 id="from-subjective-feel-to-objective-data-a-paradigm-shift-in-flow-calibration">From Subjective Feel to Objective Data: A Paradigm Shift in Flow Calibration</h2>
<h3 id="the-old-way-limitations-of-the-diagonal-surface-test">The Old Way: Limitations of the Diagonal Surface Test</h3>
<p>To fully appreciate the brilliance of the new flow calibration method, we must first understand the limitations of the one it replaces. For a long time, flow rate calibration in OrcaSlicer (and many other slicers) involved printing a series of square patches, each with a different flow modifier.[4, 5] The top surface of these squares was printed with a simple diagonal line pattern, moving back and forth at a 45-degree angle.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a></p>
<p>The process for determining the correct flow rate was almost entirely subjective. The official instruction was to run your fingers across the printed squares and select the one that felt the smoothest to the touch.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a> While this method can work, its effectiveness is heavily dependent on the user&rsquo;s experience and tactile sensitivity. A beginner might struggle to discern the subtle differences between patches, while even an expert&rsquo;s judgment could be influenced by lighting or the specific texture of the filament. This subjectivity was the primary weakness of the old system, creating a barrier to achieving consistent, repeatable results.</p>
<h3 id="introducing-the-archimedean-chord-a-smarter-pattern-for-a-smarter-slicer">Introducing the Archimedean Chord: A Smarter Pattern for a Smarter Slicer</h3>
<p>The 2.3.1 Alpha release replaces the ambiguous diagonal pattern with a far more intelligent design: a concentric pattern based on an Archimedean chord.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a> This isn&rsquo;t just a cosmetic change; it&rsquo;s a fundamental re-engineering of the test based on geometric principles.</p>
<p>An Archimedean spiral is a shape defined by a path that moves away from a central point at a constant angular velocity. In simpler terms, the distance between each successive turn of the spiral remains constant. When the toolhead of a 3D printer traces this path, it should lay down a series of perfectly concentric lines with a uniform gap between them. This geometric purity is the key to the test&rsquo;s effectiveness. Any deviation from the ideal amount of extruded filament—either too much or too little—will immediately disrupt this perfect, repeating pattern in a way that is visually and tactically obvious.</p>
<p>Unlike the old diagonal pattern, where over-extrusion might simply result in a slightly rougher surface, the Archimedean pattern provides clear, unmistakable evidence. This new test, as highlighted in the updated OrcaSlicer wiki, is now the recommended method for dialing in your flow rate.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a></p>
<h3 id="the-democratization-of-precision">The Democratization of Precision</h3>
<p>This evolution from a tactile, experience-based method to a visually explicit one represents more than just a technical upgrade; it&rsquo;s a move that democratizes precision in 3D printing. It effectively lowers the barrier to entry for achieving one of the most critical calibrations, empowering users of all skill levels to diagnose and resolve extrusion issues with a newfound level of confidence.</p>
<p>The old method relied on an acquired skill—a developed &ldquo;feel&rdquo; for surface smoothness that created a knowledge gap between newcomers and seasoned veterans.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a> The new test replaces this subjectivity with objective, observable data. Over-extrusion presents itself as distinct ridges where &ldquo;the edge of the circle is really sticking out,&rdquo; while under-extrusion creates clear &ldquo;valleys&rdquo; or gaps between the lines.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a> These are not matters of opinion; they are measurable physical artifacts.</p>
<p>This aligns perfectly with OrcaSlicer&rsquo;s overarching mission: to package &ldquo;advanced calibration tools&rdquo; within a &ldquo;user-friendly interface&rdquo; that supports a &ldquo;wide printer compatibility&rdquo;.<a href="https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer">2</a> By making a foundational calibration process like flow rate easier to perform and more reliable to interpret, the software empowers a much broader range of users to achieve superior print quality. It removes the gatekeeper of subjective &ldquo;feel&rdquo; and replaces it with the clarity of visual evidence. This new feature is a perfect encapsulation of the project&rsquo;s philosophy: it doesn&rsquo;t just add power for experts; it engineers that power in a way that elevates the entire community.</p>
<h2 id="a-practical-guide-dialing-in-your-flow-rate-with-the-new-test">A Practical Guide: Dialing in Your Flow Rate with the New Test</h2>
<h3 id="prerequisites-and-setup">Prerequisites and Setup</h3>
<p>Before you jump into printing the new calibration test, a little preparation will ensure you get the most accurate results possible.</p>
<p>First, this test is designed to refine an existing flow rate, not to establish one from absolute zero. It is most effective when you start with a filament profile that is already reasonably well-configured. The calibration test works by applying small positive and negative modifiers to your filament&rsquo;s <em>current</em> flow ratio setting. As the transcript notes, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t reset it back to one. It&rsquo;s based on what it&rsquo;s currently set at&rdquo;.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a> So, if your filament profile&rsquo;s flow ratio is already set to 0.98, the test chips will be modifiers based on that value.</p>
<p>Second, for the most scientifically accurate calibration, it&rsquo;s crucial to follow the recommended order of operations. According to the official OrcaSlicer wiki, you should always calibrate temperature <em>before</em> calibrating flow rate.<a href="https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer/wiki/Calibration">4</a> The temperature of your nozzle directly affects the viscosity of the filament, which in turn impacts how it flows. Dialing in your temperature first ensures that you are calibrating flow under the correct thermal conditions.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-launching-the-calibration-test">Step 1: Launching the Calibration Test</h3>
<p>With your slicer open and your printer profile selected, launching the new test is straightforward.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the top menu bar.</li>
<li>Click on the &ldquo;Calibration&rdquo; dropdown.</li>
<li>Select &ldquo;Flow Rate.&rdquo; A new test plate will be automatically generated in your workspace.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will see a series of small, square chips laid out on the build plate. Each chip is labeled with a modifier value, such as <code>0</code>, <code>-0.01</code>, <code>+0.01</code>, etc. This is the new, recommended test that utilizes the Archimedean pattern.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a></p>
<h3 id="step-2-printing-and-initial-observation">Step 2: Printing and Initial Observation</h3>
<p>Once the test plate is generated, simply slice it using the filament profile you wish to calibrate and send it to your printer. While it&rsquo;s printing, prepare a well-lit area for inspection. Good lighting is critical for visually identifying the subtle surface differences between the test chips.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-interpreting-the-print--the-art-of-sight-and-touch">Step 3: Interpreting the Print – The Art of Sight and Touch</h3>
<p>This is the most critical part of the process. Once the print is finished and has cooled, carefully remove it from the build plate. You will now analyze each chip, using both your eyes and your fingertips, to find the one that represents the &ldquo;Goldilocks&rdquo; zone of perfect extrusion.</p>
<h4 id="identifying-over-extrusion">Identifying Over-extrusion</h4>
<p>Over-extrusion occurs when the printer pushes out too much filament. On the Archimedean pattern, this is incredibly easy to spot.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual Cues:</strong> Look for concentric circles where the edges are raised and pronounced. As the transcript describes, &ldquo;the edge of the circle is really sticking out&rdquo;.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a> This happens because the excess plastic has nowhere to go and is forced upwards, creating distinct ridges. The surface may look overly glossy and lose fine detail.</li>
<li><strong>Tactile Cues:</strong> When you run your finger across an over-extruded chip, it will feel bumpy and rough. You will be able to clearly feel the ridges formed by the excess filament. The chips with positive modifiers (e.g., <code>+0.03</code>, <code>+0.05</code>) are most likely to exhibit these characteristics.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="identifying-under-extrusion">Identifying Under-extrusion</h4>
<p>Under-extrusion is the opposite problem: the printer is not pushing out enough filament to fill the toolpath completely.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual Cues:</strong> Look for visible gaps between the concentric lines. You may be able to see the layer below through these gaps. The transcript refers to these as &ldquo;valleys&rdquo; in the surface.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a> The surface might also have a dull, matte, or unfinished appearance because the lines are not properly squishing together.</li>
<li><strong>Tactile Cues:</strong> An under-extruded chip will feel textured or even hollow. Your finger will catch on the gaps between the lines, giving it a rough or scratchy feel. The chips with negative modifiers (e.g., <code>-0.03</code>, <code>-0.05</code>) are the primary candidates for this issue.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-goldilocks-zone--identifying-the-optimal-result">The &ldquo;Goldilocks&rdquo; Zone – Identifying the Optimal Result</h4>
<p>Your goal is to find the single chip that is perfectly smooth, both visually and by feel.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Ideal Chip:</strong> The best chip will have a uniform, smooth top surface with a consistent, healthy shine.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a> The concentric lines should be laid down perfectly next to each other with very little to no visible gaps. When you run your finger across it, it should feel almost like a single, solid surface. In my own testing for the video, the chip labeled <code>0</code> was the best, indicating my existing flow rate was already well-calibrated.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a></li>
<li><strong>An Important Nuance:</strong> It is crucial to understand one key detail from the official documentation: &ldquo;it is okay to have a visible line between the inner and outer spiral&rdquo;.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a> The goal is not to create a completely fused, monolithic surface where the lines are indistinguishable. The perfect result is one that shows distinct lines laid down with &ldquo;very little gap between&rdquo; them.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a> Do not mistake the faint line between toolpaths for under-extrusion. You are looking for the smoothest possible surface that is free of ridges (over-extrusion) and significant valleys (under-extrusion).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-applying-the-results-and-updating-your-profile">Step 4: Applying the Results and Updating Your Profile</h3>
<p>Once you have identified the best chip, updating your filament profile is incredibly simple. The value printed on the chip is the exact modifier you need to apply to your current flow ratio.</p>
<p>The logic is simple addition or subtraction:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you picked a chip with a <strong>positive</strong> value (e.g., <code>+0.02</code>), you <strong>add</strong> that value to your current flow ratio.</li>
<li>If you picked a chip with a <strong>negative</strong> value (e.g., <code>-0.03</code>), you <strong>subtract</strong> that value from your current flow ratio.</li>
<li>If you picked the <code>0</code> chip, no changes are needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use the concrete example from the transcript: imagine your filament&rsquo;s flow ratio was set to <code>0.98</code> and you determined that the chip labeled <code>+0.01</code> was the smoothest. Your new flow ratio would be $0.98 + 0.01 = 0.99$.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afuKB8T133s">1</a> This direct arithmetic is a significant improvement in user experience over older, more complex percentage-based formulas.[4, 5]</p>
<p>To make the change in OrcaSlicer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the &ldquo;Filament&rdquo; tab in the left-hand panel.</li>
<li>Click the &ldquo;Edit preset&rdquo; icon next to your chosen filament profile.</li>
<li>In the filament settings window, scroll down until you find the &ldquo;Flow Ratio&rdquo; parameter.</li>
<li>Enter your newly calculated value.</li>
<li><strong>Crucially, click the &ldquo;Save&rdquo; icon at the top of the window to save your changes to the profile.</strong> Forgetting this last step is a common mistake that will cause you to lose your newly calibrated value.</li>

	<h2 id="level-up-your-prints-why-line-width-is-your-3d-printing-secret-weapon">Level Up Your Prints: Why Line Width is Your 3D Printing Secret Weapon</h2>
<p>Hey everyone! In my latest video, I dove deep into a 3D printing setting that often gets overlooked but makes a massive difference in your final prints: <strong>line width</strong>. For a long time, I was all about chasing faster print times, but I’ve come to realize that optimizing for quality and strength is well worth a few extra minutes – and line width is a key player in achieving just that [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0jb12SLRrU&amp;t=35">00:35</a>].</p>
<p><strong>What I Learned (and You Should Too!):</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest takeaways for me was just how much line width impacts the strength of your parts. Think about it: wider lines mean more material is laid down and there’s greater overlap between those lines, especially when it comes to printing walls. This significantly reduces those annoying little voids and makes your prints much more structurally sound [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0jb12SLRrU&amp;t=85">01:25</a>], [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0jb12SLRrU&amp;t=186">03:06</a>].</p>
<p>In the video, I specifically explored the line width settings within Orca Slicer. It’s pretty cool how much control you have, with options for the default width, the first layer, outer walls, and even the top surface [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0jb12SLRrU&amp;t=98">01:38</a>].</p>
<p>Through my research (and a bit of trial and error!), I found that for a standard 0.4mm nozzle, bumping up the default line width to around 0.5mm (that’s 125%) seems to be a sweet spot. This aligns with recommendations in the Orca Slicer wiki and what others in the community are finding [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0jb12SLRrU&amp;t=310">05:10</a>].</p>
<p>The best part? I was genuinely surprised at how little impact these adjustments had on the overall print time. The test print I showed in the video only took about 7 seconds longer with the optimized settings [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0jb12SLRrU&amp;t=606">10:06</a>]. That’s a tiny trade-off for a noticeable improvement in quality!</p>
<p>Speaking of quality, I was really happy with how much cleaner the top surface looked after making these changes. You could see a real difference in how those layers blended together, resulting in fewer visible lines [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0jb12SLRrU&amp;t=682">11:22</a>].</p>
<p>Oh, and here’s a little bonus tip I shared in the video: if you’re struggling with removing support material, try using a slightly thinner line width (smaller than your nozzle diameter) for your support structures. It makes them much easier to break away [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0jb12SLRrU&amp;t=517">08:37</a>].</p>
<p><strong>Give it a Shot!</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately, what I wanted to show in this video is that taking the time to dial in your line width settings is well worth the effort. It’s all about finding that balance between print speed, the quality of your finished product, and the overall strength of your 3D prints [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0jb12SLRrU&amp;t=753">12:33</a>].</p>
<p>Check out the full video for a more in-depth look and to see the results for yourself!</p>

<p>Let me know in the comments what line width settings you’ve found work best for you – I’m always learning! What else are you curious about in the world of 3D printing?</p>

	<h2 id="finding-your-3d-printers-sweet-spot---a-guide-to-maximizing-print-speed">Finding Your 3D Printer&rsquo;s Sweet Spot - A Guide to Maximizing Print Speed</h2>
<p>Have you ever wondered how fast your 3D printer can truly go? When I get a new printer or see a new model released, the first question that pops into my head is always, &ldquo;How fast can I print with this thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This post will explore how to determine the optimal print speed for your 3D printer, ensuring both speed and quality.</p>
<h2 id="factors-influencing-print-speed">Factors Influencing Print Speed</h2>
<h3 id="print-parameters">Print Parameters</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infill</strong>: While not a major time-saver, adjusting infill patterns and density can slightly reduce print time.</li>
<li><strong>Wall Thickness</strong>: Reducing the number of walls can significantly decrease print time, but it can also compromise the model&rsquo;s strength.</li>
<li><strong>Layer Height</strong>: Increasing layer height generally speeds up printing, but it can also affect print quality and part strength.</li>
<li><strong>Other Parameters</strong>: Factors like print speed, infill density, and layer height also impact the mechanical properties of the printed part, according to research. Finding the balance between speed and strength is crucial.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="extruder-limitations">Extruder Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Max Flow Rate</strong>: Each extruder has a maximum flow rate, which determines how much filament it can push out per second. Exceeding this limit leads to inconsistent extrusion, poor print quality, and weaker parts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="determining-max-flow-rate">Determining Max Flow Rate</h3>
<p><a href="https://ellis3dp.com/Print-Tuning-Guide/articles/determining_max_volumetric_flow_rate.html">Ellis&rsquo;s Print Tuning Guide</a> provides valuable information and equations to calculate your extruder&rsquo;s max flow rate. A simple test involves extruding a known length of filament at increasing speeds until you observe a noticeable drop in extrusion quality.</p>
<p>One of the key points that Ellis&rsquo; guide points out is that using approximate values (Table 1) is possible.</p>

<h3 id="finding-the-sweet-spot">Finding the Sweet Spot</h3>
<p>Determine Max Flow Rate: Conduct tests as described above to find your extruder&rsquo;s maximum volumetric flow rate.
Set Volumetric Speed: Adjust the volumetric speed setting in your slicer software to match your calculated max flow rate.
Optimize Print Profiles: Experiment with different print speed settings for various parts of the model, ensuring that the speeds for visible features do not exceed the calculated safe limit.
Test and Iterate: Print test parts and adjust parameters based on the results. Observe print quality, part strength, and overall print time.</p>
<h3 id="important-considerations">Important Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Model Size: Smaller models may not allow the printer to reach maximum speed due to acceleration and deceleration times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Part Complexity: Complex models with intricate details may require slower print speeds to ensure accurate and high-quality results.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By carefully considering these factors and conducting thorough testing, you can optimize your 3D printer&rsquo;s print speed while maintaining excellent print quality and part strength.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This information is for general guidance only. Always refer to your printer&rsquo;s manual and manufacturer&rsquo;s recommendations for specific instructions and safety guidelines.</p>
<p>I hope this guide helps you unlock your 3D printer&rsquo;s full potential!</p>

<p>A while ago, I create the my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LlSHsa86RuT_btswmDsmQp0LrTJ9U0HJcRhorsqz1ug/edit?usp=sharing">Klipper Calibration Spreadsheet</a> to help myself keep track of and remember various Klipper formulas to tune and improve my 3D prints. I decided to share the tools and i have received lots of requests to share the Spreadsheet. Rather than giving everyone access to edit my original sheet, I have recommended to everyone to &ldquo;Make a Copy&rdquo; of the sheet for their personal use. In a lot of cases this has caused some confusion. By making a copy, there is no way to any edits or updates I do to the tools.</p>
<p>Because of this (and my desire to do a little programming), I have put together the <a href="https://minimal3dp.com/klipper-calibration/">Klipper Calibration Website</a>. The standalone site gives me an opportunity to create some useful tools and program. It also give me a way to create more detailed documentation and video links.</p>
<p>Another hope is that, because I am using <a href="https://www.docsy.dev/">Docsy</a>, I can use the tie-ins with GitHub to allow the community to comment, make suggestions, and give feedback. I could than further refine the tools. It is my hope that this site will continue to evolve over time and include additional tools.</p>
